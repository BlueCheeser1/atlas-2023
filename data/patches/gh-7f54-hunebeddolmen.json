	"description": "Dolmens are, according to the current theory, remains of prehistoric burial chambers. However, they are not to be regarded as tombs in the ordinary sense, but rather as charnel houses. It cannot be said with certainty that grave signaling was the original function of all these structures. There are dolmens that are believed to have served only as a sanctuary.\n\nIn the Netherlands they are mainly found in Drenthe, often on the Hondsrug. They were built between 3350 and 3050 BC, in the westernmost extension of the funnel-neck beaker culture territory. A total of 52 dolmens have been preserved there in the Netherlands.",
